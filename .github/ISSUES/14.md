# fetch doesn't work with "SUB" domain in repo URL

**girishkg** commented *Aug 8, 2016*

fetch is not working if there are any subdomain in the "--repo" option
fetch --repo="https://example.github.com/foo/bar" --tag="0.1.5" --release-asset="foo.exe" /tmp
## The error is:

```
[root@jenkins01 ~]# fetch --repo="https://example.github.com/foo/bar" --tag="0.1.5" --release-asset="foo.exe" /tmp
ERROR: Error occurred while getting tags from GitHub repo: -1 - 300 - GitHub Repo URL https://example.github.com/foo/bar could not be parsed correctly
```

---

"example" SUB domain is used here for demonstration purpose.

Need to change line **"102"** on **"github.go"** file
`regex, regexErr := regexp.Compile("https?://(?:www\\.)?github.com/(.+?)/(.+?)(?:$|\\?|#|/)")`

@girishkg Thanks for the issue report! I actually didn't realize github repo URLs could have subdomains, and, as you pointed out in your second comment, the code assumes all github repos are at `www.github.com` or `github.com`.

Can you give an example of a (presumably public) repo that has a subdomain in the name other than `www`? If we can determine this is a legitimate use case, I'd be happy to add support for this.
