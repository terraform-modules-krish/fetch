# How do you compile from source?

My operating system doesn't match any of the available binary releases.  How do I compile from source using `go build`?

We use [gox](https://github.com/mitchellh/gox) with the following command:

```
gox -os "<OS>" -arch "<ARCH>" -output "fetch" -ldflags "-X main.VERSION=<VERSION>"
```

For example:

```
gox -os "linux" -arch "amd64" -output "fetch" -ldflags "-X main.VERSION=v0.1.1"
```

What OS are you on?

Thanks @brikis98!  I'm using a Chromebook with armv7l architecture.

What about documenting that in README.md ?
