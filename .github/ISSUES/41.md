# Feature Request: Ability to `rename` and`chmod` resultant file

**osterman** commented *Apr 19, 2018*

## what
* I wish that we could specify the octal mode of the file download from the github release
* I wish that we could specify the destination name

## why
* So that I can set the execution bit (E.g. `0755`) without calling `chmod` explicitly
* Extremely common usage pattern is to download binary releases of apps (e.g. `fetch`) and then run them

## example interface
```
fetch --repo https://github.com/gruntwork-io/fetch \
      --tag=v0.2.0 \
      --release-asset=fetch_darwin_amd64 \
      --asset-name=fetch \
      --asset-file-mode=0755 \
        /usr/local/bin
```

`--asset-file-mode` and `--asset-file-destination` both sound like a great idea for optional params. We'd welcome a PR to add those!
