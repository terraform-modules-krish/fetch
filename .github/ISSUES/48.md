# Cannot fetch file from GitHub enterprise by commit

**sco11morgan** commented *Feb 12, 2019*

I'm using fetch v0.3.2 against our GH Enterprise instance.  The initial logging indicates Enteprise is detected 

`Assuming GitHub Enterprise since the provided url (<enterprise url>/<redacted repo>) does not appear to be for GitHub.com`

but then later on there is an error
`ERROR: Error occurred while downloading zip file from GitHub repo: 500 - Failed to download file at the url https://api.github.com/repos/<redacted repo>`

It should be using a URL beginning with `https://<enterprise url>/api/v3/<repo>`
<br />

I believe @jniesen was kind enough to add GitHub Enterprise support. Any chance you know what the issue above is?

@brikis98 I think I see the problem. Some tests need to added to `file_test.go` and URL parsing needs to be introduced into `MakeGitHubZipFileRequest` https://github.com/gruntwork-io/fetch/blob/48ae79f9b8aa0842ad22e07b2fae5e5669dcbcfc/file.go#L117

I'll be able to work on this in a few hours.

@jniesen, were you able to fix this?  Before I dig in too deep, wanted to doublecheck since we are experiencing the same issue and it is now a blocker for us.  Interested in getting it fixed, and a new release cut.

@dg-nthompson No, sorry you got blocked by this. I had to let this get this displaced by other things.

If you would like to dig in, the link in my previous comment is a good place to start. The occurence of `api.github.com` in that func and any other occurrence needs to be looked at and possibly updated to take advantage of the URL detection logic used elsewhere.

Like on this line:
```
	url := fmt.Sprintf("https://api.github.com/repos/%s/%s/zipball/%s", gitHubCommit.Repo.Owner, gitHubCommit.Repo.Name, gitRef)
```

The `api.github.com` could be replaced with `gitHubCommit.Repo.BaseUrl` like:
```
	url := fmt.Sprintf("https://%s/repos/%s/%s/zipball/%s", gitHubCommit.Repo.BaseURL,  gitHubCommit.Repo.Owner, gitHubCommit.Repo.Name, gitRef)
```

Then the bulk of the work lies in updating the tests. Also, just from looking at it some now, I'm not totally positive that you'd use `BaseUrl` or `ApiUrl`.

I hope this helps and I won't be doing any coding unless I let you know and get an ack that we're not stepping on each other's toes. Sorry again.

@jniesen, thank you for the reply!  No worries on being blocked, it was more to determine how we wanted to proceed.  @josh-padnick has been able to jump in an help, so hope to have something in place with tests when he is ready.  Thank you all!
