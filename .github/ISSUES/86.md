# Certain repos fail silently

**ddnexus** commented *Jan 30, 2021*

Works with other repos but the following fails/freezes:
```
$ fetch --repo="https://github.com/Jannomag/Yaru-Colors" --ref="20.10.1" --source-path="/Themes" /tmp/yaru-themes
Downloading git reference "20.10.1" of https://github.com/Jannomag/Yaru-Colors ...
```
It fails also with --commit, --tag, --branch etc.
Is there any way to debug what is happening?

Are you able to `git clone` that repo locally?

**ddnexus** commented *Feb 1, 2021*

Yes of course. Did you try to clone it and to run the command? I suspect you would get to the same conclusion.

Ah, I didn't realize that was an open source repo I had access to! Most people use `fetch` with private repos.

I can indeed confirm the bug. Not sure of the cause, and am too buried at the moment to dig in. If anyone has time to look into this, PRs are welcome!

Is there any flag or any other way to get a debugging feedback from fetch?

**brikis98** commented *Feb 2, 2021*

No, not currently. Better logging is something we'd like to add.

I'm unable to reproduce this, and several new tags were created shortly after this ticket was raised related to `--ref`.  I suspect this isn't an issue anymore

@ddnexus I looked into reproducing this and was unable to. This seems have possibly been fixed by updates to fetch. Closing out this issue, feel free to reopen if you encounter it again.
