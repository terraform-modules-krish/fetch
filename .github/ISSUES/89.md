# Use a proper logger

**robmorgan** commented *Feb 2, 2021*

`fetch` currently writes directly to `stdout` and `stderr`, but we should use a proper logger. That way, we'd have log levels, logs would go to `stderr`, we could swap in a logger more easily that captures the output in tests, and so on.
