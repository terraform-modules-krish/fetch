Any change to add fetch as a brew formulae?

We'd love to have fetch installable via brew, and we'd certainly welcome a contribution (to the brew repo) that enables this.

and in `apt` `yum` etc... :)

I have created a pull request for the new formula, but It seems the Homebrew CI can't find the fetch dependencies.
I have performed all the steps and it worked perfectly locally. 

Can anyone have a look at the [broken CI logs](https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-core/pull/58950/checks?check_run_id=933915146) and maybe tell me what am I missing?

We haven't updated `fetch` to use go modules yet, so it needs a `dep ensure` call before running `go build`. Have a PR coming shortly that switches over in a moment...

Ok just released the version using go modules: https://github.com/gruntwork-io/fetch/releases/tag/v0.3.10

@andreybleme can you see if that version passes the build on brew?

It passed @yorinasub17 âœ… , just need to wait for it to be merged now.
Thanks.

So, since #71 this can be closed I presume.
Thanks for your work @andreybleme, @yorinasub17 and everyone else involved.
