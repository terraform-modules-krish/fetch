# HTTPS and Self-Signed Certificate support

**flydev-fr** commented *May 31, 2021*

Hi,

I added support for `Self-Signed Certificate` with `InsecureSkipVerify: true` settable with a parameter, does a PR is welcome for this feature ? 

My use case is quite specific. I have a custom software which the goal is to update a set of executables embedded on clients in the wild, then I use `fetch` to download releases from private repo on Github. 
The issue I had is the following. The clients are behind firewalls where only our backend server is whitelisted, so a connection to Github was impossible. 
I then used NGINX as a reverse proxy to forward requests from our own domain to Github, eg: `https://github.example.com/MyAccount/MyRepo/` and now `fetch` let me download the release from this private repo using this custm URL üëç

`fetch` is an awesome tool ‚úå

Thanks for the offer! I think I'd want to have more than a single, custom use case before adding new flags/functionality. So I'd prefer to leave this issue open and see if there are other users who need something like this.

Okay @brikis98 

I fork the project, push the modifications and I will link it to this issue. This is a tool which each devops should use if they use github üòé
