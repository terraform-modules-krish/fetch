# How to download Source code (tar.gz) asset of release

**atomlab** commented *Feb 4, 2020*

Sorry, I not understand how to download release source code (tar.gz)?

```
# fetch --repo="https://github.com/hashicorp/go-version" --tag="v1.2.0"  --release-asset="v1.2.0.tar.gz" /tmp
ERROR: Could not find assets matching v1.2.0.tar.gz in release v1.2.0
```

This is not currently supported, but probably good to add. We don't have a use case internally for this so we are unlikely to add this ourselves, but would welcome a PR from the community!
