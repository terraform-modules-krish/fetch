# fetch doesn't work with "SUB" domain in repo URL

**girishkg** commented *Oct 25, 2017*

fetch is not working if there are any subdomain in the "--repo" option
fetch --repo="https://example.github.com/foo/bar" --tag="0.1.5" --release-asset="foo.exe" /tmp
## The error is:

```
[root@jenkins01 ~]# fetch --repo="https://example.github.com/foo/bar" --tag="0.1.5" --release-asset="foo.exe" /tmp
ERROR: Error occurred while getting tags from GitHub repo: -1 - 300 - GitHub Repo URL https://example.github.com/foo/bar could not be parsed correctly
```

---

"example" SUB domain is used here for demonstration purpose.

Need to change line **"102"** on **"github.go"** file
`regex, regexErr := regexp.Compile("https?://(?:www\\.)?github.com/(.+?)/(.+?)(?:$|\\?|#|/)")`

Are you using fetch to download something from these domains?

I want to use fetch for our company's github, which is hosted in a subdomain like:

https://github-stb.company.internalzone.com/

Please consider fixing this issue.

Ah, got it. Thanks for the use case! 

I agree that's worth fixing. PRs welcome :)

Attempted to repro and subdomains seem to work just fine. This issue has been open for quite some time, so I'm closing. Feel free to reopen if it resurfaces.
