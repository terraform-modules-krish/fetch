Hello Thank you for this much promising tool. 

Unfortunately I cannot get the programm to run. 

Here my cmdline output:

Can you please tell me what is actually wrong? When I am able to clone the same repo, why I am not able to run your fetcher in same context?

I want to use it, to save my all github releases and ther assets locally as fallback.
