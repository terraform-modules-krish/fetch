# Prevent silent fail

**MohammedAl-Mahdawi** commented *Jan 26, 2022*

Hi!,

We are using this command in our CI/CD pipeline:

```
fetch --repo="https://github.com/..." --tag="1.0.9" --github-oauth-token="****" --release-asset="example-v1.0.9.zip" tmp-path
```

Yesterday this command fails because of a GitHub authorization error, however, it only logs the error instead of exiting with non-zero code this causes the pipeline to continue then exist on another step that depends on what has been downloaded by `fetch`.

Please we need an option to exit on error.
<br />

Hi,
I was trying to check this issue, however, on the last version exit code is 1 in case of an error:
```
$ fetch --repo="https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terraform-aws-ci" --tag="v0.41.1" --github-oauth-token="***" --release-asset "infrastructure-deployer_linux_386" tmp-path
[fetch] ERRO[2022-01-26T23:21:59+02:00] 
Received an HTTP 401 Response when attempting to query the repo for its tags.

This means that either your GitHub oAuth Token is invalid, or that the token is valid but is being used to request access
to either a public repo or a private repo to which you don't have access.

Underlying error message:
Received HTTP Response 401 while fetching releases for GitHub URL https://api.github.com/repos/gruntwork-io/terraform-aws-ci/tags?per_page=100. Full HTTP response: {"message":"Bad credentials","documentation_url":"https://docs.github.com/rest"}

$ echo $?
1
```

On which version occurred this issue?

Hi!

Thank you for the quick reply!

We are using `v0.4.2`

I read the release notes of version `v0.4.3` before posting this and did not found anything related.

So it has been fixed in the new release?

Hi, so from the above message, in my test exit code wasn't 0 in case of failure:
```
...
$ echo $?
1
```

Exiting with non-zero code is already implemented, may be an issue with code which call `fetch` that is not handling error code? like missing `set -euxo pipefail`?

Hi!

Weird, I believe the commands in pipeline steps get wrapped in `#!/usr/bin/env bash` and executed.

We are using it as a step alone so it is executed like this:

```
#!/usr/bin/env bash

fetch --repo="https://github.com/..." --tag="1.0.9" --github-oauth-token="****" --release-asset="example-v1.0.9.zip" tmp-path
```

But everything works fine with other commands/steps!

What makes things weirder, I just tried to reproduce the issue and this time it exited with a non-zero code!
