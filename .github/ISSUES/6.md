# When the tag expression has no acceptable value, fetch defaults to the first tag.

**josh-padnick** commented *May 4, 2016*

Given:
- The repo has tags: `v0.0.1`,`v0.0.2`,`v0.0.3`
- fetch requested the repo with tag expression `~>0.0.4`

Then:
- fetch will download tag `v0.0.1` of the repo

Instead, fetch should error out and complain that no valid tag was found.
