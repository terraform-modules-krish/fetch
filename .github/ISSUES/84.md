# How to add all release files that end with file extension

**chancesmith** commented *Jan 19, 2021*

Can you use the release-asset regex to get many files that match a file extension?

`fetch --repo="https://github.com/foo/bar" --tag="0.1.5" --release-asset="*.tar.gz" /tmp`

similar to #58, but for any other files that match

I don't think this is currently supported, but would be handy to add. PR welcome!

I was just able to do the described job (fetch version - 0.4.1):
```
./fetch_linux_amd64 --tag v1.0.0 --repo https://github.com/noxdafox/rabbitmq-cloudwatch-exporter --release-asset=".*.ez" /tmp/
```
