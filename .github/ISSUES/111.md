# Does not run on Raspberry Pi 3

**kfxkaplan** commented *Sep 19, 2022*

None of the 3 linux builds will run on Raspberry Pi 3 running Debian 10 Buster. I've tried downloading and running all 3, and they all fail with the error `bash: ./fetch_linux_arm64(or amd64 or 386): cannot execute binary file: Exec format error`.

When I run `uname -m`, I get the output `armv7l`, which I believe means 32-bit ARM, which none of the 3 Linux releases covers. Is there a way I can get this to run?

Any update on this?

@Nauman3S I found a workaround using a bash script that lets me download the files associated with a specified tag, though I cannot just tell it to "download latest" like fetch would be able to do. If you are interested I can send you the script.
