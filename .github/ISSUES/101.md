# Write file to stdout

**slewis-bd** commented *Dec 29, 2021*

**Describe the solution you'd like**
When grabbing a file, it would be nice to write the file to stdout. This would be useful when downloading a script and wanting to pipe it to another command.

**Describe alternatives you've considered**
Specifying `/dev/stdout` as the filename. It's ugly but has worked.

**Additional context**
None given
