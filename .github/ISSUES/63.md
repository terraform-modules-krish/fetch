# Possible build issue: fetch_linux_amd64 v0.3.9

**ben-nz** commented *May 4, 2020*

When executing fetch_linux_amd64 0.3.9:
```
./fetch --help
./fetch: 1: --2020-05-04: not found
./fetch: 2: Syntax error: "(" unexpected
```
Prior versions execute successfully. I tried downloading a second time, same result.
