# You should be able to pass in the GitHub token via an environment variable

For private repos, this script requires you to set the `--github-oauth-token` flag. It would be more secure to read the token in as an environment variable called `GITHUB_OAUTH_TOKEN` to avoid the token being stored in bash history.
