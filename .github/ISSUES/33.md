# Bitbucket support?

**leowmjw** commented *Dec 22, 2017*

I'm interested to use fetch with Bitbucket instead of Github Enterprise; and would be interested to take a stab at implementing.

Please provide some guidance on which part of the code I should focus on to support this.  Thanks!

That would be a great addition. Unfortunately, I'm not familiar with the BitBucket APIs or if there is a golang library for them. If there is, the approach would probably be to create a `bitbucket.go` that is analogous to [github.go](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/fetch/blob/master/github.go) and to pick between them based on the URL.
