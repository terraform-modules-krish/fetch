# Incorrect error: Tag does not exist.

**josh-padnick** commented *Jul 14, 2017*

When I run `fetch` as follows:

```
fetch --tag '~>v0.0.1' --repo https://github.com/gruntwork-io/module-security --source-path="/modules/auto-update" /tmp
```

I get the following error:

```
ERROR: Error occurred while computing latest tag that satisfies version contraint expression: -1 - Tag does not exist
```

This is odd because `v0.0.1` exists on this repo and changing the tag constraint expression to `>v0.0.1` makes it work. This is clearly a bug.
