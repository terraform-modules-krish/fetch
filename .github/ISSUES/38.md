# Add support for resolving symlinks

**josh-padnick** commented *Mar 20, 2018*

I attempted to download files from a repo that looked like this:

- ...
- lib
  - script.sh
- modules
  - run-x
    - hello.txt
    - lib --> ../lib/
```

where `/modules/lib` is a symlink to `/lib/`.

I'd like `fetch` to inclue all the files in `/lib/*` (e.g. `/lib/script.sh`) in my downloads, but instead, `fetch` only includes the path of the folder to which the symlink points.

A helpful enhancement to fetch would be to optionally resolve symlinks. This could result in unexpected behavior if symlinks reference files outside the repo (but present on a local filesystem), and would represent a backward-incompatible change, so this feature should be enabled as an option, but not by default.

Completed in #40, but ultimately concluded that this feature was not necessary. See #40 for details.
