# Support git refs

**yorinasub17** commented *Sep 30, 2020*

Right now fetch supports `--commit`, `--branch`, and `--tag`, but it requires you to know which type you are passing in. This can be limiting especially in CI where the logic to know if the build is on a tag, branch, or commit sha can be quite complex depending on the platform.

Propose a unified `--ref` flag that can be used to pass in any valid git ref and `fetch` does the right thing.
