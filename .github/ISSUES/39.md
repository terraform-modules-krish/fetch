# No warning when fetch downloads 0 files.

Sometimes, fetch will download no files at all, for example when the `--source-dir` property specified a file/folder prefix for which there are no files. This isn't an error, but it'd be nice if Fetch gave a warning that explicitly said no files were downloaded.
