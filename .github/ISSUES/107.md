# Support for fetching multiple tools using some declarative configuration

**iilyak** commented *Apr 26, 2022*

**Describe the solution you'd like**

Add command line argument to specify a configuration file which would contain list of repositories to download in parallel.
My use case is to bootstrap environment using following algorithm.

1. download a bunch of tools and verify sha256 of each downloaded artifact. 
2. Then do `chmod +x` for each one of them. 
3. Finally only iff sha256 is verified move the file to its final destination

Bonus feature: Ability to specify dependencies between the tools to establish right installation order.

**Describe alternatives you've considered**

1. use `jq` to get list of targets and sha and combine it with shell scripts involving sha256,chmod,curl
2. put urls and SHAs into a bash array and iterate over in a function

None of the above solutions would be portable enough, cannot provide parallel downloads and decent error handling. 

**Additional context**

There are similar tools. However there is none which do both batch artifact download and verification:
