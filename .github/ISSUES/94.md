# Does fetch support git-lfs?

**Celthi** commented *Mar 27, 2021*

Some large files in github are used git-lfs and will the `fetch` download those files with the real content instead of the pointer file?

I'm not sure! We haven't tried it with Git LFS. My guess is that, as `fetch` calls `git clone`, it'll _probably_ "just work," but if you have a chance to try it, let us know!

@brikis98 
I had a try and it does not work. The file downloaded is the pointer file like
```
version https://git-lfs.github.com/spec/v1
oid sha256:**
size 278593866
```
The `git-lfs` will need another authentication according to the API.

Ah, bummer. Well, PRs to add support are welcome.

I would like to make this enhancement but it will take some tme.
