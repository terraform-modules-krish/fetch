I kicked off the build and it passed on CI!

@brikis98 is there a repo where it'll be okay to upload multiple release assets to help with testing? I don't want to pollute any of our actual repos.

It would make sense to use these:
https://github.com/gruntwork-io/fetch-test-public
https://github.com/gruntwork-io/fetch-test-private

Do you have access to these @tonerdo ? (credit to @yorinasub17)

@rhoboat I don't have access to create new releases on https://github.com/gruntwork-io/fetch-test-public. I don't have access to https://github.com/gruntwork-io/fetch-test-private at all

@brikis98 I was only able to add a test for an asset with the `+` sign. Good thing is that when I try to upload files containing other regex characters, GitHub simply converts them to `.`.
