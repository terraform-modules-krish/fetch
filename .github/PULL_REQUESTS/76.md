# Show file count on zip extraction

**pete0emerson** commented *Oct 22, 2020*

This closes #39 

The route I took here was to just show the non-directory file count every time; if you'd prefer that I follow the letter of the issue and only print when the number of files is zero, I can make that change.

I also did a minor "look and feel" by pluralizing the wording, I think it's a nice touch, but it does add a bit of extra code (no ternary operator in golang), so I'm happy to change that if desired, too.

I realized that I marked these issues as resolved when probably it's best for you to mark them as resolved once you agree that the issue is actually resolved! Not positive exactly which workflow you prefer.
