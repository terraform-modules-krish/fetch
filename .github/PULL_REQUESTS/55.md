# Check and report error on empty option values

**vedala** commented *Aug 30, 2019*

Please review my PR with changes to fix issue #31.

The issue mentions that an incorrect error is reported on supplying empty value to option --branch. But the same issue can happen when an empty value is supplied to any of the other options. This PR fixes the issue for all options.

I modified the parseOptions() function to return an additional value for error. I felt this resulted in least complicated code.
