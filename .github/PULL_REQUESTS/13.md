# Release asset

**brikis98** commented *Jun 19, 2016*

This PR allows fetch to download not only source files from GitHub repos, but also binary files from GitHub releases. It’s easy to download a release asset from a public repo, as you can just `wget` the URL, but for private repos, it’s a confusing, painful, multi-step process that involves making several API calls. There is an [SO thread about it](http://stackoverflow.com/a/35280061/483528) which would probably love to hear that `fetch` makes this an easy one-step process.

As part of this PR, I’ve also made a few other tweaks:
1. Added support to fetch to read the GITHUB_OAUTH_TOKEN from an env var, which is much safer than as a command line option.
2. Instead of a filter passed as a command-line arg, you can now specify one or more paths to download from the source code using the `--source-path` option.
3. Similarly, you can download one or more release assets using the `--release-asset` option.

@josh-padnick I think you're out at a conference today, so I'm going to merge to unblock myself. Please review when you get back.

This is still queued up for my review, but I wanted the record to reflect it closes https://github.com/gruntwork-io/fetch/issues/7 and https://github.com/gruntwork-io/fetch/issues/9.
