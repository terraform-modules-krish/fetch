# Add the ability to pull from a specific branch or git commit

**josh-padnick** commented *Apr 28, 2016*

While developing `install-packer-module` I realized, that, for dev purposes, I needed the ability to install a packer module that had not yet been published. The packer-module-in-progress was located either in a branch or was a specific commit.

This PR:
- Enables fetch to pull from a specific git commit or branch
- For a branch, fetch just pulls the latest commit on the branch
- README update
- Fixed a bug relating to handling an empty `--tag` constraint.

@brikis98 Merging now because this is a dependency on something else, but feedback welcome as always.

Looks like a really nice improvement. I made one comment about how to design your types. The basic idea to keep in mind is, as much as is reasonable in the language and use case, to make [illegal states unrepresentable](https://fsharpforfunandprofit.com/posts/designing-with-types-making-illegal-states-unrepresentable/).
