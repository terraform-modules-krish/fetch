# Run goimports and update all caps constants to idiomatic go

**yorinasub17** commented *Oct 1, 2020*

__This is purely code style and formatting__

- Run `goimports` on all go source files.
- Update go constants using all caps (except for `VERSION` which is set at compile time via the linker option) with idiomatic go of snakeCase. This is something we've been doing in all the other repos to conform closer to the go style guide.

Thanks for review! Will merge this in (but hold off on cutting a release since this is just internal style changes).
