# added fix and test for issue #6

**austinfrey** commented *Feb 24, 2017*

OK @brikis98 this should do it. Apologies for the changes and clutter regarding the indents ... :/

**Test output before change:**
```
--- FAIL: TestGetLatestAcceptableTagNoSuchTag (0.00s)
        tag_test.go:137: Expected 'Tag does not exist' but received nothing
FAIL
coverage: 49.4% of statements
exit status 1
FAIL    _/home/src      8.597s
```

**Test output after change:**
```
PASS
coverage: 50.2% of statements
ok      _/home/src      8.482s
```

Let me know if there is anything else needed!

Thanks @aafrey. Unfortunately, it looks like the indentation on a lot of the code has been changed, including parts you weren't modifying as part of this bug fix. What editor are you using? 

Also:

```
--- FAIL: TestExtractFiles (0.00s)
        file_test.go:241: Failed to extract files: open test-fixtures/fetch-test-public-0.0.1.zip: no such file or directory
```

Why is that test failing?

@brikis98 originally I'd been using Vim, and then switched to Atom. There were some settings in place that converted the tabs to spaces and switching back did not seem to fix it correctly. Since the changes were so small, I'll just start fresh rather than try and fix the indents. I'll look into that failed test as well.

Great, thanks! Apologies for all the [yak shaving](http://sethgodin.typepad.com/seths_blog/2005/03/dont_shave_that.html) for such a simple fix :)

No worries, this kind of stuff is good experience. So hopefully the next one will go more smoothly :)

I've updated the test output in my first comment. The other error was user error and passes now. I think the indentation should now be fixed, but please let me know otherwise. Thanks! @brikis98

Ah, perfect. Thank you, merging now :)

I just created a new release here: https://github.com/gruntwork-io/fetch/releases/tag/v0.1.1. If the build passes, the new binaries should show up there in a few minutes.
