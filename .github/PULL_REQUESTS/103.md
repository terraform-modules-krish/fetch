@robmorgan I agree on test cases and I spent some time thinking through them.. Any idea how to mock a `cli.Context`? That's my blocker.

@tonerdo you could try to create an integration test in `integration_test.go` with something like:

```go
func TestFetchWithStdoutOption(t *testing.T) {
	tmpDownloadPath, err := ioutil.TempDir("", "fetch-stdout-test")
	require.NoError(t, err)

	repoUrl := "https://github.com/gruntwork-io/fetch-test-public"
	releaseTag := "v0.0.4"
	releaseAsset := "hello+world.txt"

	cmd := fmt.Sprintf("fetch --repo %s --tag %s --release-asset %s --stdout false %s", repoUrl, releaseTag, releaseAsset, tmpDownloadPath)
	t.Logf("Testing command: %s", cmd)
	stdoutput, _, err := runFetchCommandWithOutput(t, cmd)
	require.NoError(t, err)

	// Ensure the expected file was downloaded
	assert.FileExists(t, JoinPath(tmpDownloadPath, releaseAsset))

	// When --stdout is specified, ensure the file contents are piped to the standard output stream
	assert.Contains(t, stdoutput, "hello world")
}
```

Maybe if you do a loop with 2 test cases it might cover each code path?

Ah! Didn't realize we had integration tests. Thanks for the pointer
