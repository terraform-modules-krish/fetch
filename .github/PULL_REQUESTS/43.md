# support github enterprise by allowing custom api and base urls

**jniesen** commented *Aug 9, 2018*

Fetch seems like a much more enjoyable way to fetch release artifacts from GitHub on the command line. More enjoyable then writing a curl script and more reusable. 

However, I'm working with repos in both GitHub Enterprise (GHE) and GitHub.com. These changes make it so that I can pass in the URLs (base and api) of the GHE instance that I'm working with and be able to fetch artifacts from there.

I did some basic smoke testing on this. I was able to fetch from GHE. I can add/fix tests if it's required for merge, it just won't be until tomorrow.

Updated to address the things brought up in the last round of review. Thank you for adding me to the repo. I was able to get the complete test suite passing.
