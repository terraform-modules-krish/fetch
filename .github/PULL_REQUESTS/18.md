I am unable to run test. I see the following error. 
```
ERROR: These tests require that env var GITHUB_OAUTH_TOKEN be set to a GitHub Personal Access Token.
See the tests cases to see which GitHub repos the oAuth token needs access to.
exit status 1
FAIL	_/home/amir/git/amirhammad/gocode/fetch	0.003s
```
Could you help?

As the error message says, you need to set the `GITHUB_OAUTH_TOKEN` environment variable. [Follow these instructions](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-an-access-token-for-command-line-use/) to get a token. Expose it as an env var as follows:

```
export GITHUB_OAUTH_TOKEN=(your token)
```

Then run the tests.

Note that the tests that access private GitHub repos in the gruntwork-io repo will fail; you can ignore those.

Thank you for your help. I added two commits. Output of the command `go test` is:

If the CI tests pass, I'll create a new release of `fetch`, and you'll be able to grab new binaries there.

Maybe using some CI tool, you can at least show status of those tests here in github pull requests. TOKEN can be stored encrypted in the repository and then decrypted by the CI to run tests (shippable, travis, other?). 
Thank you for a great tool

Looks great, guys. Just don't forget to update the `README.md` to clarify that fetch now supports downloading a specific tag.
