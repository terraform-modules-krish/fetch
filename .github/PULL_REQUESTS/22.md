# added additional constraint check for ~> matching

this should fix  issue #6 where the `~>` operator finds an acceptable tag on what should be an unavailable tag.

Hi @brikis98 , so my little if statement returns `latestTag` which, up until this point in the program has not been assigned since no matching tags have been found. An error is thrown and handled after the `getLatestAcceptableTag` function returns to the main function with an empty latestTag value. I can add an error here, though, if you'd like. Would `return latestTag, wrapError(errors.New("Tag does not exist"))` be OK?

>Download and file extraction complete.
```

after the change  
```
fetch --tag="~>v0.0.4" --repo https://github.com/gruntwork-io/fetch-test-public ~/tag-test
ERROR: The commit sha, tag, and branch name are all empty.

Ah, gotcha. Yea, please return a custom error message so it's clear what happened. "The commit sha, tag, and branch name are all empty" is not accurate and will confuse users. Once that and the automated test are added, this will be ready to go!
