# Add CircleCi Context

**brikis98** commented *Sep 8, 2020*

This repo was using a custom set of credentials for Phx DevOps and our GitHub machine user. I've removed those creds from the CircleCi config and here am switching the repo to use [CircleCi Contexts](https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/contexts) instead.
