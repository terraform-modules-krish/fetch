# Skip tags that are not Semantically Versioned

**pete0emerson** commented *Oct 22, 2020*

This closes #75 

I validated each tag, discarding any that aren't SemVer.

For testing, I suggest that a non-SemVer tag be added to the public and private test repositories `github_test.go`.

> Could you add an automated test to validate this behavior?

I've added `expectedNumTags` and set it to `3` for https://github.com/gruntwork-io/fetch-test-public and `1` for https://github.com/gruntwork-io/fetch-test-private (for which I don't have access, so I can't verify that `1` is correct, but I think it is since `firstReleaseTag` and `lastReleaseTag` are both set to `v0.0.2`).

To fully be confident this is always working, I'd suggest adding a couple of non-SemVer tags to both of those repositories; the expectedNumTags values I've set shouldn't change, but having a "bad" tag in there will then hit the code that skips those tags.

Nice, thanks!

I added a non-semantic tag to both repos that looks like this: https://github.com/gruntwork-io/fetch-test-public/releases/tag/non-semantic

Done, and my local tests are passing until I hit the private repos.
