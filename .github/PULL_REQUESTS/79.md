# Implement git refs

This closes #73 

This implements a `--ref` flag which can be used instead of `--tag`, `--branch`, or `--commit`.

The only reason for keeping the other flags around is for backwards compatibility. Once any uses of it are moved over to `--ref`, those could be trashed. I'd do that in a separate PR.
