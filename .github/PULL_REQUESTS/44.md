# Update dependency reference 

**DorfilIkatu** commented *Oct 12, 2018*

github.com/codegangsta/cli has moved to gopkg.in/urfave/cli.v1. Github is automatically redirecting requests to codegangsta, but it is recommended to update the references.

LGTM, thx! How did you test this change?

I'm adding the `fetch` tool to a SDK using Yocto. I was already able to build `fetch` and it's dependencies. But I realize I was having two dependencies that had exactly the same source code (`github.com/codegangsta/cli` and `gopkg.in/urfave/cli.v1`). 
What happened was that `fetch` imports `github.com/codegangsta/cli` which is redirected to `gopkg.in/urfave/cli.v1`, and `gopkg.in/urfave/cli.v1` was importing itself (https://github.com/urfave/cli/blob/934abfb2f102315b5794e15ebc7949e4ca253920/altsrc/flag.go#L9), so I ended up with the both dependencies.
After making the change, `fetch` tool stills builds correctly and I can use it with no problems in my SDK.

OK, great, thanks. I'll merge and let the tests run. If they pass, I'll create a new release and paste the link.
