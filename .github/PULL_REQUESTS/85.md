This is https://github.com/gruntwork-io/fetch/pull/83 re-opened with some minor clean up. This should fix #26 and #46. Thank you to @m-bal for doing most of the work!

Thank you so much for making the changes. Sorry, I've been super busy for the past few days, so I wasn't able to work on the changes you suggested. 👍🏽 🙏🏽
