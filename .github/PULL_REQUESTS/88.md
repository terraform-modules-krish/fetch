# Pete/87/broken branch

**pete0emerson** commented *Feb 1, 2021*

This closes #87.

This has no additional tests yet.

We don't have specific tests for `MakeGitHubZipFileRequest`, which I modified to put the conditional for GitRef last.

We do test `downloadGithubZipFile` which calls `MakeGitHubZipFileRequest`, and it seems like our test `TestDownloadGitBranchZipFile` would be designed to catch this. Here's the logic that I unwrapped for this particular case:

```
since options.GitRef is not specified
    code detects a tag with a tag constraint

since there is no specific release that matches the version constraint
    latestTag is set to the latest release it can find
    desiredTag is set to latestTag

desiredTag is passed into downloadSourcePaths as latestTag

in func downloadSourcePaths
    GitRef and GitTag are both set to latestTag
    BranchName will exist, as well
    but this is where ordering is important
    GitRef needs to be checked last, otherwise downloading a branch cannot work
```

I'm open to suggestions on improving testing here, it seems like `downloadGithubZipFile` would need to be tested with multiple things set to make sure it does the right action, but I'm not positive.

Here's the evidence of this fixing the problem @brikis98 encountered. I also ran all of the tests, and they're passing.

```
# Test with --branch
 fetch git:(pete/87/broken_branch) $ ./fetch --repo="https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terraform-google-ci" --branch="gcp-helpers" --source-path="/modules/gcp-helpers" "/tmp/download-dir/gcp-helpers"
Downloading latest commit from branch "gcp-helpers" of https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terraform-google-ci ...
Extracting files from <repo>/modules/gcp-helpers to /tmp/download-dir/gcp-helpers ... 3 files extracted
Download and file extraction complete.

# Test with --ref
 fetch git:(pete/87/broken_branch) $ ./fetch --repo="https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terraform-google-ci" --ref="gcp-helpers" --source-path="/modules/gcp-helpers" "/tmp/download-dir/gcp-helpers"
Downloading tag "gcp-helpers" of https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terraform-google-ci ...
Extracting files from <repo>/modules/gcp-helpers to /tmp/download-dir/gcp-helpers ... 3 files extracted
Download and file extraction complete.

# Testing TestDownloadGitBranchZipFile (which wasn't broken before, either)
 fetch git:(pete/87/broken_branch) $ go test -v -run TestDownloadGitBranchZipFile
=== RUN   TestDownloadGitBranchZipFile
=== PAUSE TestDownloadGitBranchZipFile
=== CONT  TestDownloadGitBranchZipFile
--- PASS: TestDownloadGitBranchZipFile (1.37s)
PASS
ok  	github.com/gruntwork-io/fetch	1.529s
```

Hey @pete0emerson, 

Thanks for submitting a fix so quickly! I tested your logic locally and I can confirm it works with my use case. In regards to your comments around testing, I think the right way to solve this is with integration tests! That way we can easily assert our intended behavior from a 9000ft view and not in all of these individual functions. I've gone ahead and added one specifically for branches to this PR (more info below), however, since I'm now a contributor to this PR, we'll need to get @brikis98 to review.

Side note: with your latest change, I think we might need to adjust the help text here https://github.com/gruntwork-io/fetch/blob/master/main.go#L69 as I believe git references will no longer override commits, tags or branches. However, I may have interpreted that incorrectly?

#### Integration Tests

Whilst inspired by the [integration tests](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/blob/master/test/integration_test.go) in Terragrunt, this was slightly non-trivial for `fetch` as we write directly to `os.Stdout()` and `os.Stderr()`. Therefore I had to do some voodoo magic in `runFetchCommandWithOutput` to temporarily override these pipes.

Feel free to let me know what you think.
