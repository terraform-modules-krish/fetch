# fixes issues 26 & 46. Added support for pagination

**m-bal** commented *Jan 4, 2021*

`FetchTags` only returns the first 30 tags so 

`fetch  --repo https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terratest --tag="<0.2.0"  ./LocalDir`

fails with ` ... Tag does not exist` because terratest has 200+ tags and 0.2.0 isn't in the first 30 tags. 

I increased the `per_page` result to 100 and added a loop to get the next link from the [link header](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/rest/guides/traversing-with-pagination). 

I believe this fixes both issue #26 and #46.

Alright, I may have to wrap this PR up myself... I'm going to create a new PR with your commits, and fix the final few issues on top of that.

OK, I've opened https://github.com/gruntwork-io/fetch/pull/85 to wrap this up. Thanks!
