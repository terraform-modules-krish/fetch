# Add support for two digit versions - vX.Y

**tomdee** commented *Mar 4, 2018*

The version parsing library already supports them, but it normalizes
all version strings to have three components. This fix properly handles
versions that have been normalized in that way.

Fixes #24

@brikis98 I've addressed your comment and added some test cases. I've just amended my previous commit as this change is quite small, PTAL.

I'll merge now and let the tests run. Once they pass, I'll issue a new release.
