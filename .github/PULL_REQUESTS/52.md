# Enable asset downloads from GitHub Enterprise

**josh-padnick** commented *Apr 18, 2019*

Fixes #48. This is a tricky one to test because we don't have a running instance of GitHub Enterprise against which we can run integration tests. So the best we can do is to validate that the URL fetch attempts to download from in the case of GitHub Enterprise is as expected.

I also noticed a few areas where errors were being swallowed so I added some boilerplate error handling code for those cases. 

In the end, for the +178 lines of code additions here, the actual bug fix just 4 lines of code.

Tested this out this evening, and looks to fix [#48](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/fetch/issues/48) that I was seeing in our GHE implementation

Ok, great. PR feedback incorporated, tests pass, real-world use case validated. I think this is ready to merge. Releases should auto-populate in a few minutes.
