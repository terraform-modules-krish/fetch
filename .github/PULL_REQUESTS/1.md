# Initial release.

**josh-padnick** commented *Apr 21, 2016*

This PR represents v0.0.1 of fetch, a tool for downloading files directly from a specific GitHub tag. See the README.md for all the details. 

I believe the nicest aspect of this tool is that you can specify version constraints for which tag to download. As a convenience, it will then download that zip file, extract only the files you need, and move them to your local destination of choice.

It does not yet validate the download with any kind of signature, but that's a sensible next step.

The only remaining item is to implement the `extractFiles()` function, but I'm out of time for the day so will finish this up first thing tomorrow, and wanted to get your feedback in the meantime.

Nice work on this. The tests are excellent. And judging by [this thread on SO](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/20396329/how-to-download-github-release-from-private-repo-using-command-line), there is a lot of need for this. In fact, when this tool is done, I'd highly recommend posting a link to this tool in that thread :)

Such helpful feedback. Thank you! More than eager to wrap this up. Will push final commits and merge shortly.

Ok, finally done and ready to merge. Circle is acting funny today and the builds are delayed even though I can't see any other builds running in our account. They're also reporting degraded service in AWS.

I'll wait a bit to see if it comes back online, otherwise, once this is a blocker -- which is in just a few mins, I'll just merge.

Thanks again for the helpful feedback.

This code is looking great. I left a few more minor comments. Once you have the test issues resolved, feel free to merge. Thanks!
