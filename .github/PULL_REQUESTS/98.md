# update dependencies

running into the following problem installing fetch:
```
go get: github.com/gruntwork-io/gruntwork-cli@v0.7.2 updating to
	github.com/gruntwork-io/gruntwork-cli@v0.9.2: parsing go.mod:
	module declares its path as: github.com/gruntwork-io/go-commons
	        but was required as: github.com/gruntwork-io/gruntwork-cli
```

use `go-commons` instead of the deprecated `gruntwork-cli`
